💡 Core Idea: Attention Derivatives
A trading platform where users buy/sell exposure to trending attention — not price.

Instead of speculating on token price, users speculate on how much attention something will receive across platforms like Twitter, Farcaster, YouTube, etc.

Think:

“I think $PEPE will have 5x more mentions in the next 24h” → Buy a Long Attention Contract
“I think $DOGWIFHAT will trend less tomorrow” → Buy a Short Attention Contract

🧠 Why It's Unique
Dimension	Why It Stands Out
🧠 New Primitive	Everyone trades price. But attention precedes price, and you're turning that into a tradable asset.
📈 Predictive Alpha	Traders can front-run attention surges before price reacts.
🧩 Composable	Attention tokens could underlie or power derivative markets, prediction games, and social trading bots.
🐒 Cultural Fit	Fits the degen/memecoin meta where attention literally drives value.

🧪 Example Flow
User A sees $FLOKI trending across Twitter & Reddit

They go long on $FLOKI.ATTN24H (derivative expiring in 24h)

Chainlink Functions or Automation captures mention counts from:



Reddit , cryptocompare,twitter,github star

Oracle aggregates attention data and finalizes the attention index at expiry

User A either gains or loses based on how much attention the token gained vs. others

📊 Instrument Design
Derivative Type	Description
🧩 Attention Futures	Per-token contracts expiring in 24h, 48h, 7d
⚖️ Attention Index Options	Bet on average attention delta of top 10 tokens
📈 Leveraged Tokens	$PEPE3XATTN — leveraged attention gain
📉 Inverse Attention Tokens	Bet on tokens losing attention (short exposure)
